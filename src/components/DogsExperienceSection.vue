              <ul>
                <li>Cammi, Snowbelts Charming Invitation, is almost three years old now and is quickly becoming the champion in the family. She competes in EXC B Standard in Agility almost every weekend and we will be going to AKC Agility Nationals this year in North Carolina. She achieved her MACH on November 2nd, 2008 at the Clarion Canine Obedience Club. She currently stands with 20 double Q's and over 900 points. (The requirements for MACH are 20 double Q's and 750 points). 
                </li>
                <li>Cammi is definitely the leader of the pack. The other girls know that she is boss. She also absolutely loves agility and always gets excited when she sees the jumps being set up. Her favorite treats are bits of cheesesticks. She even learned to peel them after she mastered opening her Christmas presents.
                </li>
                <li>Cammi's parents are Briarbrook's Justin Case, "Justin" and Snowbelt's Engraved Invitation, "DeeDee". Cammi has strong working drive for an Aussie and she is always eager to please.
