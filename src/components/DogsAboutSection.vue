    <div class="h-50"></div>

     Halee's passion for dog agility began at the young age of 13. Since then, she has been dedicated to honing her skills and achieving remarkable milestones in the world of AKC canine competition.

     One of her proudest achievements was with her remarkable dog, Cammi, who earned her MACH title at the prestigious Clarion Canine Obedience Club on November 2nd, 2008. This accomplishment stands as a testament to Halee's unwavering commitment and the strong bond she shares with her four-legged companions.

     Halee's journey into the world of agility traces back to her early involvement in the local 4-H program. It was here that she cultivated her passion alongside her first faithful companion, Meggie, a cherished Golden Retriever. Their partnership laid the foundation for Halee's agility journey, eventually leading her to the delightful world of Australian Shepherds.

     After Meggie's passing in February 2006, Halee found inspiration and guidance in Cammi, her first Australian Shepherd. The intensive agility training that followed was under the expert tutelage of Denise Thomas at Countryside Agility. Simultaneously, Patti Herhold of Snowbelt Aussies played a pivotal role in shaping Halee's conformation training. Both mentors, Patti and Denise, were instrumental in her growth and success. She now trains with the world renown, Terry Simons, in California.

     Halee's dedication to her craft was truly remarkable. At the age of 17, she earned the prestigious title of the #1 ranking Junior Agility Handler in the U.S. in 2007. Due to her dedication and commitment, she earned the #1 Junior Agility Hander ranking back to back in 2008. Throughout this time, she eagerly participated in competitive dog and confirmation shows, continuously refining her skills and expertise.In 2008, Halee's hard work and determination culminated in a monumental achievement â€“ a MACH ranking with Cammi. Together, they garnered an impressive collection of 20 double Q's and amassed over 900 championship points.  Her Junior Agility Handler career culminated at Concord, NC at the Agility Nationals where she competed alongside Cammi and other top agility handlers in the United States.
