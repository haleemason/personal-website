        <div class="h-50"></div>
        <p>Halee has been showing dogs since she was 14 years old.</p>
    
        <p>Cammi achieved her MACH at the Clarion Canine Obedience Club, November 2nd, 2008!</p>

        <p>I first became interested in Agility through my local 4-H program with my first dog, Meggie, who was a Golden Retriever. We learned to work together and before long I got to meet Cammi. She was my first Australian Shepherd. Meggie passed away in Feb, 2006 and is dearly missed. If not for her, I would not have achieved what I did with Cammi. Meggie helped me to begin my agility training with Cammi. I began intensive agility training with Denise Thomas at Countryside Agility and my conformation training took place with Patti Herhold of Snowbelt Aussies. Patti and Denise were both huge mentors for me. Patti has bred all of my Australian Shepherd dogs: Cammi, Savannah, & Vee.</p>

        <p>When I was 17 years old I was ranked the #1 ranking Junior Handler in the U.S. in 2007. During this time, I was attending competitive dog and confirmation shows as often as possible. In 2008 I achieved a MACH ranking with Cammi. She stands with 20 double Q's and over 900 points. We are planning to go to Nationals this March.
